# Summary
Low-cadence, high-force aerobic work to build torque control, postural stability, and durable climbing strength without excessive recovery cost.

## When to Use
Late Base to establish torque mechanics; Early Build to consolidate; Race Prep to maintain neuromuscular specificity for climbing.

## Variants & Progression
### Variants Overview
- **Seated Torque:** stability & glute drive at 50–60 rpm.  
- **Standing Torque:** whole-chain tension & balance at 45–55 rpm.  
### Variant Usage Logic
Seated for baseline control and tissue load tolerance; standing for specific climbing stability and posture.  
### Progression Rules
Week-to-week: extend time-in-tension, not force; prioritize technique quality and cadence retention.

## Session Design
Structure archetypes only (e.g., discrete torque blocks within an aerobic ride; terrain = gentle climbs or erg). Maintain smooth force; quiet upper body.

## Intensity Protocol
RPE 4–6/10 aerobic; %HRmax ~70–85%; monitor HR drift and posture. Stay below threshold; torque is the stressor.

## Fueling Protocol
CHO 40–60 g/hr (Z2 torque), hydrate 500–800 ml/hr, sodium 500–900 mg/hr. Recovery: CHO+protein within 60 min. *Female-specific:* avoid low energy availability.

## Safeguards
Strict technique; gradual load; stop on knee/hip pain; prefer warm conditions for tissue readiness.

## Adaptations & Testing
↑ strength endurance, ↑ torque control, ↑ climbing stability. Field anchors: cadence retention, HR drift, stable RPE.

## Integration & Substitution
Pairs with Z2 LSD and Sweet Spot blocks. Sub with Z2 Hills if mechanics degrade.

## Block Integration — Signal to Fire
**Where it fits:** Late Base (primary), Early Build (support), Race Prep (maintenance).  
**Frequency:** 1×/week typical; reduce in VO₂-focused weeks.  
**Testing / Feedback:** Stable cadence & posture at target torque; HR drift <5%.

## Science Behind
Strength endurance at low cadence increases force per stroke within aerobic constraints; supports motor unit recruitment and connective tissue tolerance.

## Real-World Best Practice
High-performance programs integrate torque 1×/wk in Base→Build, often on controlled terrain or erg. Emphasis on form first; load second.

## Coach Notes
Cue glute drive, tall torso, smooth ankle; cap torque if posture breaks.
